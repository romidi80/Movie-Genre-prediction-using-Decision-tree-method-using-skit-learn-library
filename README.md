Predicting the movie genre labels using decision tree method and tokenizing text.

The objective of this project is to address missing data within a dataset through predictive methods utilizing the scikit-learn library. The project commences by focusing on the task of imputing the absent values. Various techniques will be applied, including imputing the empty cells with the mean of the existing values within their respective columns. These methods will subsequently be critically examined and discussed.

The subsequent phase entails the exploration of scikit-learn's library capabilities. A central objective is to identify an optimal model within the library that can effectively predict values for our dataset. This involves leveraging a specific function that gauges the compatibility of different models with our dataset. In particular, this predictive model aims to estimate the target column while considering one of the features present in the CSV file.

Additionally, an essential facet of this project is the analysis of the features present in the CSV file. This analysis aims to determine which feature holds the most significant potential as a predictor. Specifically, the project seeks to predict movie genres as the output, underscoring the importance of identifying the feature that yields the most accurate predictions in this context.

To sum up, the project's primary goal is to address data gaps by employing predictive techniques from the scikit-learn library. This encompasses exploring various imputation methods, evaluating different models, and identifying the most influential feature for predicting movie genres. The result of these efforts will contribute to enhanced dataset completion and informed genre predictions.
